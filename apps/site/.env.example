#   2. Set CMS_URL below to where the CMS is running (default: http://localhost:3001)
#   3. Start the site: pnpm --filter @repo/site dev
# =============================================================================

# Required for login and dashboard. Must point to the running CMS.
# Local: use the URL/port your CMS runs on (default 3001).
# Production: set in Vercel to your deployed CMS URL (e.g. https://your-cms.vercel.app). No trailing slash.
CMS_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Optional – dashboard app links. Defaults below work if those apps run on the usual ports.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_CHOICE_URL=http://localhost:3002

# Optional. Single secret for all activity links (image-choice, audience-poker, stakeholder-map).
